This project, titled "Deepfake Generation," focuses on the fascinating and advanced technique of face swapping using the insightface library. The core functionality involves seamlessly replacing a face from a source image onto a target image, creating a new, "deepfaked" image.

Project Description
This project demonstrates a straightforward yet powerful method for generating deepfake images through automated face swapping. It leverages the insightface library, an open-source toolkit renowned for its capabilities in face analysis and recognition. The process intelligently detects faces in both a source image (providing the face) and a target image (receiving the face), then uses a specialized model to perform the swap, ensuring a natural and realistic blend.

Key Features
Automated Model Download: The necessary inswapper_128.onnx model, crucial for the face-swapping operation, is automatically downloaded from Hugging Face upon execution.

Interactive Image Upload: Users can easily upload their desired source and target images directly within the execution environment (e.g., Google Colab).

Robust Face Detection: The FaceAnalysis model from insightface is employed to accurately identify and locate faces within both input images.

Seamless Face Swapping: The project utilizes the inswapper_128 model to execute the face swap, focusing on precise alignment and blending for high-quality results.

Output Generation: The final face-swapped image is saved to a designated output directory, and also displayed for immediate review.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for the project.

insightface: A comprehensive library used for both face detection and the core face-swapping functionality.

onnxruntime: Provides an efficient runtime for executing ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) models, specifically for the inswapper_128.onnx model.

OpenCV (cv2): Utilized for fundamental image processing tasks such as loading, manipulating, and saving images.

Numpy: Essential for numerical operations and efficient handling of image data arrays.

Pillow (PIL): Used for various image manipulation tasks.

How It Works
Environment Setup: The project begins by installing all required Python libraries, including insightface, onnxruntime, opencv-python, numpy, and pillow. It also sets up necessary directories for storing input images, output results, and models.

Model Acquisition: The inswapper_128.onnx pre-trained face swapper model is automatically downloaded from a Hugging Face repository to the local models directory.

Image Input: The user is prompted to upload two images: a "source image" containing the face to be extracted, and a "target image" where the source face will be superimposed.

Face Analysis Initialization: An instance of the FaceAnalysis model is initialized to prepare for accurate face detection.

Face Swapper Initialization: The downloaded inswapper_128.onnx model is loaded and prepared for face-swapping operations.

Face Swapping Execution:

Both the source and target images are loaded into memory.

Faces are detected within both images using the initialized FaceAnalysis model.

The first detected face from each image is selected for the swapping procedure.

The swapper.get() method then performs the face swap, blending the source face onto the target image while maintaining visual coherence.

Result Output: The resulting image, with the swapped face, is saved as swapped_image.png in the output directory and displayed to the user.

Usage
This notebook is designed for interactive execution, ideally in a cloud-based environment such as Google Colab. Users can simply run the cells sequentially, uploading their chosen source and target images when prompted to generate their own face-swapped images.

# Poison Attack

This project, titled "Poisoning Attack Demonstration," provides an interactive and visual exploration of data poisoning attacks against machine learning models. It demonstrates how malicious data points can be strategically injected into a training dataset to manipulate a model's behavior and compromise its integrity.

Project Description
This notebook serves as an interactive educational tool to illustrate the concept and impact of data poisoning attacks in machine learning. It guides users through the process of training a baseline neural network model, subsequently introducing various forms of "poisoned" data into the training set, and then visualizing the resulting degradation in model performance and changes in decision boundaries. The project typically uses widely recognized image datasets like MNIST or FashionMNIST for its demonstrations.

Environment Setup: All necessary Python libraries, including TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, and IPywidgets, are imported to set up the working environment.

Dataset Loading: A standard image classification dataset (such as MNIST or FashionMNIST) is loaded to serve as the foundation for training and attack simulations.

Model Definition: A neural network architecture suitable for the chosen dataset is defined.

Baseline Training: The model undergoes initial training on the pristine dataset to establish its normal performance metrics, which serve as a comparison point.

Interactive Attack Phase:

Functions are implemented to generate various types of poisoned data. This can involve subtly modifying image pixels or overtly changing the labels of selected training examples.

IPywidgets provide an interface for users to specify attack parameters, such as the number of data points to poison or the target class for a directed attack.

Interactive buttons allow users to initiate different attack scenarios and observe their effects in real-time.

Model Retraining: The model is then retrained (or fine-tuned) using the dataset that now includes the maliciously crafted poisoned samples.

Evaluation and Visualization:

The performance of the model, after being exposed to poisoned data, is re-evaluated to quantify the attack's success (e.g., a drop in accuracy).

Visualizations clearly show the poisoned images themselves and how these malicious inputs alter the model's predictions on both clean and poisoned data, providing a concrete understanding of the attack's impact.

Usage
This notebook is designed for interactive use within environments like Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. Users can execute the cells sequentially, experiment with different attack parameters using the interactive widgets, and directly observe the consequences of data poisoning on the machine learning model. This hands-on approach makes it an effective resource for learning about adversarial machine learning and model security.
